## üìå Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Strengthen my Python programming skills
- Serve as a public learning log
- Showcase my commitment to learning Data Science
- Provide practical coding examples for others who may be on a similar path

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.13
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## üöÄ What's Next

I'm currently focusing on core Python, and soon I will:
- Upload practice notebooks on OOP, libraries etc.
- Begin building data analysis and machine learning projects
- Share end-to-end portfolio projects
