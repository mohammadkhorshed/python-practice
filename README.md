# Python Practice

Welcome to my Python practice repository! 👋  
I'm **Mohammad Khorshed Alam**, a Civil Engineering graduate transitioning into the field of **Data Science**. This repository is where I document and share my journey — starting with Python fundamentals and progressing toward real-world projects.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `fundamentals/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with foundational Python exercises.
  - `variables.ipynb`: 25 beginner-to-advanced problems on Python variables.
  - `strings.ipynb`: 25 practice exercises to master Python string manipulation.
  - `if-else.ipynb`: 25 basic-to-advance exercises of Python if-else statement.
  - `loops.ipynb`: 50 easy-to-hard exercises to master `for`, `while`, and `nested loops` in Python.
  - `list.ipynb`: 30 intermediate-to-advance exercises on Python list.
  - `tuples.ipynb`: 20 practice exercises to master Python tuples.
  - `sets.ipynb`: 25 basic-to-advance exercises of Python sets.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Strengthen my Python programming skills
- Serve as a public learning log
- Showcase my commitment to learning Data Science
- Provide practical coding examples for others who may be on a similar path

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.13
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 What's Next

I'm currently focusing on core Python, and soon I will:
- Upload practice notebooks on functions, OOP, libraries etc.
- Begin building data analysis and machine learning projects
- Share end-to-end portfolio projects
